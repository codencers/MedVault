#Problem We solved
The traditional EHR system has the following flaws:<br>
‚ùå Data Privacy & Security Risks ‚Äì Centralized databases are vulnerable to hacking, risking sensitive patient information.<br>
‚ùå Lack of Patient Ownership ‚Äì Patients have no full control over their health data, relying on institutions for access.<br>
‚ùå Interoperability Issues ‚Äì Incompatible hospital systems prevent seamless data exchange.<br>
‚ùå Data Integrity & Authenticity ‚Äì Medical records can be tampered with or lost due to technical failures or attacks.<br>
